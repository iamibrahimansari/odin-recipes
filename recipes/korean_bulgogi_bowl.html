        <h1>Korean Bulgogi Bowl</h1>
        <p>
            If you love Korean food, you have to try this amazing twist on
            bulgogi beef! Bulgogi is usually made with thinly shaved slices of
            beef, marinated and flame licked. This dish, on the other hand, has
            the delicious taste you know and love, but is made with ground beef
            and served as a rice bowl. The whole recipe is anxiety-free and
            takes just a few minutes. Your kids and friends will love this
            healthier dinner, and you will feel like you're on the streets of
            Seoul.

        <h2>Steps / Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef
                in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
                Drain and discard grease. Mix in sesame oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine brown sugar, soy sauce, water, Asian pear, garlic,
                ginger, red pepper flakes, and black pepper in a food processor.
                Blend until combined but still slightly chunky. Pour mixture
                into the skillet with the beef and cook over medium heat until
                most of the liquid evaporates, 7 to 9 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place 1/4 the cooked brown rice in the bottom of an individual
                serving bowl. Top with a portion of beef mixture, lettuce,
                cucumber, red bell pepper, and sesame seeds. Repeat with
                remaining rice, beef, and toppings.
